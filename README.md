# Prerequisite
* git (https://git-scm.com/)
* docker (https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
* docker-compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

See more here: https://docs.docker.com/


# Usage

## Get started

1. Install docker and docker-compose, "Docker for Windows" or "Docker for Mac"
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/hackmdio/docker-hackmd.git`
3. Change to the directory `docker-hackmd` directory
4. Run `docker-compose up` in your terminal
5. Wait until see the log `HTTP Server listening at port 3000`, it will take few minutes based on your internet connection.
6. Open http://127.0.0.1:3000


## Update

Start your docker and enter the terminal, follow below commands:

```bash
cd docker-hackmd ## enter the directory
git pull ## pull new commits
docker-compose pull ## pull new containers
docker-compose up ## turn on
```

### [migration-to-0.5.0](https://github.com/hackmdio/migration-to-0.5.0)


We don't use LZString to compress socket.io data and DB data after version 0.5.0.
Please run the migration tool if you're upgrading from the old version.

1. Stop your hackmd containers
2. Modify `docker-compose.yml`, add expose ports `5432` to `hackmdPostgres`
3. `docker-compose up` to start your hackmd containers
4. Backup DB (see below)
5. Git clone above `migration-to-0.5.0` and `npm install` (see more on above link)
6. Modify `config.json` in `migration-to-0.5.0`, change its `username`, `password` and `host` to your docker
7. Run migration (see more on above link)
8. Stop your hackmd containers
9. Modify `docker-compose.yml`, remove expose ports `5432` in `hackmdPostgres`
10. git pull in `docker-hackmd`, update to version 0.5.0 (see below)



## Backup

Start your docker and enter the terminal, follow below commands:

```bash
 docker-compose exec database pg_dump hackmd -U hackmd  > backup.sql
```


## Restore

Similar to backup steps, but last command is
```bash
cat backup.sql | docker exec -i $(docker-compose ps -q database) psql -U hackmd
```

# Kubernetes

To install use `helm install stable/hackmd`.

For all further details, please check out the offical HackMD  [K8s helm chart](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/hackmd).

# Custom build

The default setting would use pre-build docker image, if you want to build your own containers
uncomment the `build` section in the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/hackmdio/docker-hackmd/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) and edit the [`config.json`](https://github.com/hackmdio/docker-hackmd/blob/master/config.json).

If you change the database settings and don't use the `HMD_DB_URL` make sure you edit the [`.sequelizerc`](https://github.com/hackmdio/docker-hackmd/blob/master/.sequelizerc).
